    "# Swiss Security Man staring COMP2420 Radcliffe\n",
    "\n",
    "What is security important?\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Infosec is a priority for us. We've been doing stupid stuff for a while we'd like to keep secret\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about security the first things you need to consider are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the risk\n",
    "- What is the asset\n",
    "- What sort of means do you have at your disposal to mitigate that risk for that asset\n",
    "\n",
    "Security itself has 3 main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Confidentiality: preventing unauthorized disclosure\n",
    "2. Integrity: information can only be modified when it is supposed to\n",
    "3. Availability: only available to authorised users\n",
    "\n",
    "These make up the \"CIA\" triad which is a model designed to guide policies for information security within large organisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also a 4th unofficial main component of security:\n",
    "\n",
    "Authenticity. Authenticity is the proof that the person accessing your system is who they say they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different types of threats\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interruption: attack on availability\n",
    "- Interception: attack on confidentiality\n",
    "- Modification: attack on integrity\n",
    "- Fabrication: attack on authenticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these attacks can be categorised in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Passive attacks (snooping, monitoring, etc.) -- where you're merely listening to what is happening\n",
    "2. Active attacks (packet modification, message replay, DDOS) -- where you're actively doing something to the network\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of security\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encryption: protect information\n",
    "- Signature: a method of authentication\n",
    "- Protocol: a standardised way of communicating\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic model of secure communications\n",
    "\n",
    "![images/basic-secure-communications.png](images/basic-secure-communications.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Symmetric Key Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the sender and receiver have the same key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption:\n",
    "> c = E<sub>k</sub>(m)\n",
    "\n",
    "Decryption:\n",
    "\n",
    "> m = D<sub>k</sub>(c)\n",
    "\n",
    "Always true:\n",
    "> D<sub>k</sub>(E<sub>k</sub>(m)) = m\n",
    "\n",
    "Not always true:\n",
    "\n",
    "> E<sub>k</sub>(D<sub>k</sub>(m)) = m\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting a cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "- Security\n",
    "- Speed (hardware and software implementation)\n",
    "- Ease of implementation (is it simple?)\n",
    "- Flexibility (can I use different keys?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### DES\n",
    "\n",
    "- A symmetrics key cipher\n",
    "- Developed by government, in use from 1970 until 2000.\n",
    "- Superseded by AES\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a 56-bit key (initially was supposed to use a 128-bit key, but that changed at some point... _conspiracy?_)\n",
    "- The security of AES is based on the strength of the key because the algorithm is public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input is re-ordered using an initial permutation\n",
    "- Block is then split into two sub-blocks\n",
    "- It then follows 16 rounds of encryption\n",
    "- In each round of encryption the left half is the old right half, and the right half is generated using an aglorithm.\n",
    "- Each round a 48-bit subm key is generated and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "How hard is it to break DES?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because the key is 56 bit, there are 2^56 possible keys. You could _just_ try all of them.\n",
    "- In July 1998 it took 4.5 days and 250000 dollars\n",
    "- By January 1999 it took 100000 pcs and 22 hours and 15 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people make DES more secure by doing a thing called \"Double-DES\" and \"Triple DES\". This is essentially piping DES into DES, or DES into DES into DES, respectively. Each time with different keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AES\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adopted in October 2000\n",
    "- Became the US government standard in 2002.\n",
    "- Keys vary from:\n",
    "    - 128\n",
    "    - 192\n",
    "    - 256 bits\n",
    "- Block size of 128 bits\n",
    "- Number of iterations (respective for different key lengths):\n",
    "    - 9\n",
    "    - 11\n",
    "    - 13\n",
    "\n",
    "### AES vs DES\n",
    "\n",
    "- AES is faster than DES\n",
    "- AES is more secure than DES given its larger key size\n",
    "- AES is more flexible for differing security requirements (given three key  size choices)\n",
    "- But AES may not be the best at any aspect compared to other block ciphers. It just meets the requirements of the US government.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diffie Hellman key exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation: traditionally, the only way to share a secret key was to meet up in person and hand it over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DH key exchange was invented as a solution to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Alice         | Public        | Bob |\n",
    "| ------        | ------        | --- |\n",
    "| a             | g, n          | b    |\n",
    "| g^a mod n     |  <- shared -> | g^b mod n |\n",
    "| (g^b)^a mod n |    _          | (g^a)^b mod n |\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Small prime `g` and large prime `n` are public numbers\n",
    "2. Alice chooses her secret, a\n",
    "3. Bob chooses his secret, b\n",
    "4. They do `g^a mod n` and `g^b mod n` respectively, and share those numbers into the public space\n",
    "5. Alice takes Bob's number and takes it to the power of a, Bob does the same but with Alice's key and `b`.\n",
    "6. Now they both have the same secret number: `g^(ab) mod n`. It can be used for a reliable symmetric secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with DH\n",
    "\n",
    "- Man in the middle attack\n",
    "\n",
    "![images/dg-mitm.png](images/dh-mitm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mallory stands in between Alice and Bob and acts as their partner in their respective DH key exchanges. This means she can read anything sent between the two and can record it (_or modify it_) as she likes! Yikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RSA\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a public key?\n",
    "    - your public key is a _publicly available_ key which is _hopefully_ tied to your identity\n",
    "- What is a private key?\n",
    "    - another key (read: _not the same as your public key_), which you keep very very secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup:\n",
    "1. Choose large primes `p` and `q`, take `n = p*q`\n",
    "2. Choose random number e satisfying `gcd(e, (p-1)(q-1)) = 1` and `1 < e < (p-1)(q-1)`. Our public key is now (e, n)\n",
    "3. Choose random number d satisfying `ed mod (p-1)(q-1) = 1` (ie. `d` is a modulo inverse of `e`).\n",
    "4. Take the message `m`, `m < n` must be true (split into `m` into chunks if false\n",
    "\n",
    "To encrypt: `c = m^e mod n`\n",
    "\n",
    "To decyrpt: `m = c^d mod n`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key points of security\n",
    "\n",
    "- If factorisation of n can be done, the RSA is now broken.\n",
    "- Breaking the RSA system is no harder than the factorisation of n, but it's publicly believed that is is no easier either.\n",
    "- Practically, we use 2048 bit or 4096 bits in our keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RSA vs DES\n",
    "\n",
    "- RSA is about 100 times slower than DES.\n",
    "    - Making DES suitable for bulk encryption, and DES suitable for short messages \n",
    "- DES is based on tricky design as opposed to \"mathematical toughness\", like RSA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixing DH with RSA\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix DHs MITM vulnerability we can do something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alice and Bob both generate a public/private key pair, put the public key somewhere publicly accessible, and keep the private key to themselves.\n",
    "- Before they share their `g^a mod n` and `g^b mod n` numbers, they encrypt them using the recipients public key.\n",
    "- Because the only way the messages can now be decrypted is through the recipients private key, MITM attacks are no longer viable (assuming everyone keeps their keys secret)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other types of public key systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- ElGamal: discrete logarithm based system\n",
    "- Rabin: Similar to RSA, with security equivalent to factorisation\n",
    "- McEliece: base on error-correcting codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah, I don't know what any of those mean either."
