    "# Swiss Security Man staring COMP2420 Radcliffe\n",
    "\n",
    "What is security important?\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Infosec is a priority for us. We've been doing stupid stuff for a while we'd like to keep secret\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about security the first things you need to consider are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the risk\n",
    "- What is the asset\n",
    "- What sort of means do you have at your disposal to mitigate that risk for that asset\n",
    "\n",
    "Security itself has 3 main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Confidentiality: preventing unauthorized disclosure\n",
    "2. Integrity: information can only be modified when it is supposed to\n",
    "3. Availability: only available to authorised users\n",
    "\n",
    "These make up the \"CIA\" triad which is a model designed to guide policies for information security within large organisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also a 4th unofficial main component of security:\n",
    "\n",
    "Authenticity. Authenticity is the proof that the person accessing your system is who they say they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different types of threats\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interruption: attack on availability\n",
    "- Interception: attack on confidentiality\n",
    "- Modification: attack on integrity\n",
    "- Fabrication: attack on authenticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these attacks can be categorised in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Passive attacks (snooping, monitoring, etc.) -- where you're merely listening to what is happening\n",
    "2. Active attacks (packet modification, message replay, DDOS) -- where you're actively doing something to the network\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of security\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encryption: protect information\n",
    "- Signature: a method of authentication\n",
    "- Protocol: a standardised way of communicating\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic model of secure communications\n",
    "\n",
    "![images/basic-secure-communications.png](images/basic-secure-communications.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Symmetric Key Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the sender and receiver have the same key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption:\n",
    "> c = E<sub>k</sub>(m)\n",
    "\n",
    "Decryption:\n",
    "\n",
    "> m = D<sub>k</sub>(c)\n",
    "\n",
    "Always true:\n",
    "> D<sub>k</sub>(E<sub>k</sub>(m)) = m\n",
    "\n",
    "Not always true:\n",
    "\n",
    "> E<sub>k</sub>(D<sub>k</sub>(m)) = m\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting a cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "- Security\n",
    "- Speed (hardware and software implementation)\n",
    "- Ease of implementation (is it simple?)\n",
    "- Flexibility (can I use different keys?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### DES\n",
    "\n",
    "- A symmetrics key cipher\n",
    "- Developed by government, in use from 1970 until 2000.\n",
    "- Superseded by AES\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a 56-bit key (initially was supposed to use a 128-bit key, but that changed at some point... _conspiracy?_)\n",
    "- The security of AES is based on the strength of the key because the algorithm is public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input is re-ordered using an initial permutation\n",
    "- Block is then split into two sub-blocks\n",
    "- It then follows 16 rounds of encryption\n",
    "- In each round of encryption the left half is the old right half, and the right half is generated using an aglorithm.\n",
    "- Each round a 48-bit subm key is generated and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "How hard is it to break DES?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because the key is 56 bit, there are 2^56 possible keys. You could _just_ try all of them.\n",
    "- In July 1998 it took 4.5 days and 250000 dollars\n",
    "- By January 1999 it took 100000 pcs and 22 hours and 15 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people make DES more secure by doing a thing called \"Double-DES\" and \"Triple DES\". This is essentially piping DES into DES, or DES into DES into DES, respectively. Each time with different keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AES\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adopted in October 2000\n",
    "- Became the US government standard in 2002.\n",
    "- Keys vary from:\n",
    "    - 128\n",
    "    - 192\n",
    "    - 256 bits\n",
    "- Block size of 128 bits\n",
    "- Number of iterations (respective for different key lengths):\n",
    "    - 9\n",
    "    - 11\n",
    "    - 13\n",
    "\n",
    "### AES vs DES\n",
    "\n",
    "- AES is faster than DES\n",
    "- AES is more secure than DES given its larger key size\n",
    "- AES is more flexible for differing security requirements (given three key  size choices)\n",
    "- But AES may not be the best at any aspect compared to other block ciphers. It just meets the requirements of the US government.\n",
